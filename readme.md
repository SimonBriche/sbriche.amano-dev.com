#Simon BRICHE Website#
A place to save my website's files
 
##But...##
This responsive website is created with :
* Boostrap V3 with implementation of :
	* offcanvas template
	* css forms
	* modal window
	* carousel 
* JQuery with implementation of :
	* form validation plugin
	* DOM content generation based on an XML file
	* retina device detection
	* retina images if needed
* AngularJS :
	* DOM content update based on an XML file and user interaction
* LESS :
	* files structure compiled with brackets's LESS AutoCompile plugin  
Thus, it's also a good template to start with (and a good remainder too).  
Feel free to use those files.
